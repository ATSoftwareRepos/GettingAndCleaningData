The purpose of the document is to describe the contents of this repository.

This repository contains two other files: run_analysis.R and codeBook.txt

	run_analysis.R is a script file which analyzes data taken from Samsung data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
	When run it will ask for the location of the unzipped folder where the data is stored. 
	It will create many data tables and perform the following functions on the data:

		Create two tables for the training and test data
		Merge the training and test data
		Assign proper names to the variables in the data
		Convert the TASKS into factors with the proper names
		Summarise the data and write it to summarydata.txt in the Samsung data folder


	codeBook.txt describes the variables in the data set of finaltable and the summarydata table
